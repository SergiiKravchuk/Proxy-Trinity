# Welcome, Design Patterns enthusiast 🧑‍💻

This repository contains practice exercises to get familiar with **Adapter**, **Proxy**, and **Decorator** design patterns.

## Prerequisites:
* [JDK 11+](https://jdk.java.net/11/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## How to start practicing? 💪
* check the [onboarding presentation](https://github.com/SergiiKravchuk/Proxy-Trinity/blob/practicing/Codeus%20Proxy%20Trinity.pdf) on **Adapter**, **Proxy**, and **Decorator** design patterns
* choose `practicing` branch - contains everything you need for practice: READMEs, general docs, and tests.
* open one of the `org.codeus.patterns.case1-case3` packages, check local README, and follow the instructions.
  The main goal - refactor small modules applying one of the patterns above.
* run case-specific tests to verify your implementation (e.g.`org.codeus.patterns.case1.Case1Test` for case 1).

If you are stuck, you can:
* check the **Hints** section in the cases README file for general hints or step-by-step implementation hints.
* check the `completed` branch to see the completed implementation.
